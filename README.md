Anything can change! These are all more or less first hand ideas, please feel free to come up with new ideas regarding how we should do this bearing in mind the main concept which is                        
A-Secure-Decentralised-Social-Network.
(a new way of using the internet responsibly) 

The Open Community came to life having at it’s core the main idea of offering a clear visibility to groups of people and communities. In the beginning it wanted itself to be a social network in which people who had social initiatives, i.e. underground or less known cultural communities, groups of people who had social activities like playing sports, going out clubbing, or simply just meeting to do whatever they wanted, to be able easily find themselves and share their hobbies or passions. At this moment it wants itself to be something bigger and in due time all shall be explained. Until then I will start with the beginning so please bear with me.

“Hai să...!” or “Let’s..!” wanted itself to be an application on mobile phones and a website in which people posted a tag on an interactive map of their city with their preferred activity, and anybody could’ve seen it and responded to it. It’s practical. Basically you find people to do stuff with. It couldn’t have been done due to my stubbornness regarding the name. When I wanted to buy the domain I found out that it was taken and I couldn’t come to an agreement with the owner. The name wanted to [www].haisa.ro. So the idea was postponed 

At this moment 10/06/2014 We have bought www.haisa.eu !! so this will be the starting point!

Then came Open Community.

Open Community is “Hai să...!”’s evolved version. While you still have the above mentioned possibilities, them being incorporated in this website and application, Open Community helps you find groups of people that share your interests, whatever they may be. 

How do I find you?

The Open Community’s interface provides the user the with the easiest way of finding these people. It will be built upon easy search criterias such as: >country>city>community or >country>city>category. 
The interface or the front end has to be built very dynamic when referring to the search. You could imagine a round globe, or a circle which has categories like   culture, sports, outdoor, games, or anything you could think of, and you can either search by interacting with it or when you type anything in, the search box responds dynamically. Some of these main categories are generic and are built in by default but when the user creates a community, he has the ability to create a custom sub-category which better explains his interests and the search bubble[globe] is automatically populated with this new sub-category under the main ones . If there is a request coming from a group of communities that share the same interests, a main category can be created.
The search page also needs to have an event criteria: event>country>city>category*
*linked to the categories under which the communities have been created.
e.x. Basketball > you will be given the communities that either have events with basketball, or their main interest is basketball or if someone posted under the “Let’s..!” page a basketball event. 



The Community Panel.

The Community Panel let’s the owner or the delegated user by the owner to add events or make changes. 
* The panel that is provided by default by the Open Community Team only contains a chat panel that loses it’s logs after a week or so, due to the technical necessity of clearing up space on the servers[this will be explained later on],  but the owner has the ability to mark and save useful logs to the community. 
* An event or managing panel should be available at all times that is linked to the search bar from the search page.
*If the owner of the community has a website, it can be linked on the page. His webpage is opened in the community panel.
*If owners choose to host their panel on their server[also explained later] such as a raspberry pi, a heap load of other options come up. 
-> He will have access to an incredibly dynamic panel, think of adobe flash where you can create buttons, shapes, backgrounds, basically anything, a creative platform you may call it. 
->If the owner has a small server[raspberryr pi], he can host his blog/website under oppencommunity.ro, thus giving the opencommunity.ro platform the capacity to be a hibrid host of websites. We simply make their websites more accessible under everything that opencommunity.ro stands for.

Backbone, technology, innovation and adapting a social network to an ongoing need for a private and secure environment.
 
The backbone needs to provide a way of a hybrid decentralised encrypted data storage. We do not wish to keep your chat logs, or personal information more than we have to. For example, let’s say that a user im’s another user. If the second one isn’t online, we keep his message encrypted  on our server, when he is available we send the the message to his own application and afterwards we delete it. When it comes to a larger group of people, let’s say the community panel, we do the same. We keep the latest message for a week or so until every person has received it. If that week has passed, the user still has the chance to automatically upload the older ones from the existing online peers, who have the ability to store everything they want. 
To experience the best out of this platform it is required to have the desktop or phone application installed. From here you manage your data. Be it photos, videos or text. Two clicks away selection and deletion of old or unused storage.

Tech to be used

Open Community’s struggle will be to implement, if possible, existing technologies.
All of these technologies are open-source distributed under the GNU licence so with permission from the owner we could do something with them. 


ZeroTierOne(a virtual local area network)

It would be really nice to implement the zerotierone’s ideea of a single virtual lan on which everybody is. Think of the gaming community’s satisfaction. The following is taken from Adam Ierymenko  https://www.zerotier.com/index.html website which says “Ethernet virtualization is perfect for startups without fixed abodes, highly mobile consulting teams, companies spread across several offices, collaborative research groups that span academic boundaries, groups of friends who want to share files and play games, or anyone else who wants a local area network that isn't so... local.” 


Building a website as a regular user via MediaGoblin.(http://mediagoblin.org/) 

 As I see it MediaGoblin gives all the power to the user. This is copied from MediaGoblin main website. They describe and make everything as simple as possible. “ MediaGoblin is a free software media publishing platform that anyone can run. You can think of it as a decentralized alternative to Flickr, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.” It's also: 
The perfect tool to show and share your media!
Building tools to empower the world through decentralization!
Built for extensibility. Multiple media types, including video support!
Part of the GNU project and devoted to user freedom.
Powered by a community of people like you!ople like you.


To be continued… basically http://redecentralize.org/interviews/ has many of our answers.
